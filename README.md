# Summarize Grades

The Summarize Grades program is a file I/O reformatter that takes a text file, which includes students names, scores, and number of assignments, and saves them into maps for reformatting later. This program has the functions of reading a file and saving the student's information in maps, correct the student's names in a specific format with proper casing, calculating the total of the student's grade and final percentage, and outputting the information to a new text file in an organized way, displaying the student's name, total, and percentage. With this program, I practiced File I/O and maps, as well as further improved my C++ skills.

## Organization

The code is organized into three files: SummarizeGrades.h, SummarizeGrades.cpp and demo.cpp. This program also includes a Makefile. Inside the SummarizeGrades.h header file, all the functions are included but not defined. The SummarizeGrades.cpp file includes the header file and defines all the function bodies, going into detail on how they all work. Finally, demo.cpp runs the main method, which displays all of the functions included in the SummarizeGrades.cpp file.

## Compiling and running code

To compile the code:
- Open Terminal
- Navigate towards the location of the files / Makefile.
- Type "make" onto the terminal.

To run the code:
- After compiling, type "./demo"
